# meatspace

## Tools for a Shadowrun GM (or player)

To use meatspace, click the green "clone or download" button on the repo page, and download as a .zip file.

Extract the zip to your desired location, and then open the "meatspace.html".

**Please note**

Once you have unzipped to your desired location, you must keep the file structure as-is (unless you know how to repoint the various Javascript and CSS links).
